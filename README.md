**A VHDL project for a FPGA board Box** <br/> 
Simulation of the famous game 'Catch The Mole' on a FPGA board (Altera Cyclone V) using VHDL. </br>
The project has been designed building different functional blocks with specific purposes and relative interactions. </br>
The hardware description has been made using VHDL language by Intel Quartus Prime software. </br>
The simulation of system interactions was made by ModelSim simulator, and then the implementation has been done interfacing the simulator one, with Altera board. </br>
The system controls 4 leds associated to 4 different possibile states of the mole: when the mole is on the specific spot, the led changes itself. </br>
Four buttons are associated to the four leds: the system checks if the right button is pressed respect to the mole position. </br>
The 7-segment displays shows the user time left, to hit the right button and the number of mole hit so far. </br>
